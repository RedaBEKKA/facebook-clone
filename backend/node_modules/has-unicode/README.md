/*

Here we gather node-pre-gyp generated options (from versioning) and pass them along to node-gyp.

We massage the args and options slightly to account for differences in what commands mean between
node-pre-gyp and node-gyp (e.g. see the difference between "build" and "rebuild" below)

Keep in mind: the values inside `argv` and `gyp.opts` below are different depending on whether
node-pre-gyp is called directory, or if it is called in a `run-script` phase of npm.

We also try to preserve any command line options that might have been passed to npm or node-pre-gyp.
But this is fairly difficult without passing way to much through. For example `gyp.opts` contains all
the process.env and npm pushes a lot of variables into process.env which node-pre-gyp inherits. So we have
to be very selective about what we pass through.

For example:

`npm install --build-from-source` will give:

argv == [ 'rebuild' ]
gyp.opts.argv == { remain: [ 'install' ],
  cooked: [ 'install', '--fallback-to-build' ],
  original: [ 'install', '--fallback-to-build' ] }

`./bin/node-pre-gyp build` will give:

argv == []
gyp.opts.argv == { remain: [ 'build' ],
  cooked: [ 'build' ],
  original: [ '-C', 'test/app1', 'build' ] }
